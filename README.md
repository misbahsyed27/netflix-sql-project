# Netflix Data Cleaning & Analysis (SQL Project)

This project focuses on data cleaning, exploration, and analysis of the Netflix dataset using **MySQL**. It demonstrates my ability to work with real-world data, clean it efficiently, and extract meaningful insights that can help guide business decisions.

---

## Overview

- Cleaned and structured raw Netflix data (~6,000 records) for analytical use.
- Used SQL to handle missing values, standardize inconsistent data, and fix formatting issues.
- Analyzed trends such as top genres, most active production countries, and yearly content growth.
- Designed SQL queries to uncover insights and support strategic content decisions.
- Created visuals using Tableau to enhance storytelling and interpretation.

## Data Cleaning Steps

- Removed duplicates
- Handled `NULL` values in key columns like `director`, `country`, and `date_added`
